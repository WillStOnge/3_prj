                <p>Work study as part of your financial aid award indicates eligibility for a job within Yale. There are a number of jobs within the School of Art (admissions, labs, studio crews, etc.) that paid $14.25 per hour in 2017-18. If you are awarded a job within the School, you will be notified by the supervisor. Generally, it will involve four-to-six hours a week during the regular academic year only. Art positions may be limited and not all MFA students necessarily will be assigned a job within the School. So it is suggested you examine the Yale Student Employment Office (246 Church Street) online student job search. This job search engine lists campus, community service (Federal Work Study) and other categories of employment for which you can apply online.</p>

             <div class = "box" id = "P2"> <h2>TEACHING ASSISTANTSHIPS.</h2>
                 
               <p>Appointments to assistantships are made by the dean and faculty of the School of Art and are awarded only to second-year students. A student may not apply for an assistantship because all appointments are based on individual merit and performance qualifications and not on financial need. Teaching assistantships may be for one or two terms and the gross monthly payments (which generally range between $500 and $700) are based on the number of class hours and sections.</p>
